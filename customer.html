      <p class="customerbio">  Hi! I'm Betsy! I love my fur baby Oscar so so so much! Oscar is a 3 year old golden doodle who LOVES to play and cuddle.  He needs a lot of exercise and even MORE attention. It's Oscar's world, I'm just living in it.</br>
        My hobbies include running, hiking, traveling, gardening and in the summer, hosting pool parties for my friends.  I'm 38 years old, single and live in Pennsylvania where I settled after I finished college.</p>
